  <h2>What is Bahasa Indonesia and 한국어?</h2>
  <strong><u>Indonesian</u> <a href="file:///C:/Users/rladm/Desktop/WEB/1.html" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">(bahasa Indonesia)</a></strong> is the official language of Indonesia. It is a standardized variety of Malay, an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the multilingual Indonesian archipelago for centuries. Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the world, with over 270 million inhabitants—of which the majority speak Indonesian, which makes it one of the more widely spoken languages in the world. <p>Most Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in at least one of the more than 700 indigenous local languages; examples include Javanese and Sundanese, which are commonly used at home and within the local community. However, most formal education and nearly all national mass media, governance, administration, and judiciary and other forms of communication are conducted in Indonesian.

  <p style="margin-top:45px;"><strong><u>Korean</u> (South Korean: <a href="file:///C:/Users/rladm/Desktop/WEB/1.html" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">한국어</a>, hangugeo)</strong> is an East Asian language spoken by about 80 million people, mainly Korean, as of 2020. It is the official and national language of both North Korea and South Korea (originally Korea), with different standardized official forms used in each country. It is a recognised minority language in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of Jilin Province, China. It is also spoken in parts of Sakhalin, Russia and Central Asia.</p><p> Modern Korean is written in Hangul, a system developed in the 15th century for that purpose. Modern Hangul uses 24 basic letters and 27 complex letters. Originally, Korean was a spoken language, as written records were maintained in Classical Chinese, which is not mutually intelligible with either the historical or modern Korean languages, even in its spoken form. Hanja, Chinese characters adapted to the Korean language, are still used to a very limited extent in South Korea. Over the past 80 years of division, both have developed local accents.</p>
